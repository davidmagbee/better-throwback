### More to come...

This application is an initial build, and will certainly evolve over time. Keep an eye out on this build and forthcoming branches as this app evolves and various implementations of this application are executed.


> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
